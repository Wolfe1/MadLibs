MadLibs
=======

A simple MadLibs game written in Java. Written for a class in school and I figured I would put it up
if anyone would find some use for it.

The game Takes files written in mtl(madlib text language) and uses them to get the amount of blanks 
and the type of word that will be used in each blank. After the user has input all their words they
hit the create story button and their MadLib story will be created. The user can then choose to save
their story if it is particularly funny.

Example file format:

<madlib>
<title>The Great Ice Storm</title>         
<body> 
                      
It was the Winter of <blank><type>year</type></blank>, the end of the
<blank><type>season</type></blank> semester at 
<blank><type>university</type></blank>. The worst ice storm in                  
<blank><type>number</type></blank> years hit the state. People were
trapped in their <blank><type>plural noun</type></blank>, and the
<blank><type>plural noun</type></blank> were closed. To everyone's
surprise, President <blank><type>person's name</type></blank> did not cancel
classes! On my way across campus, I fell on my <blank><type>body
part</type></blank> and broke my <blank><type>noun</type></blank>. I
could barely contain my <blank><type>emotion</type></blank>! At least
it's all behind us now.
                                                                                
</body>                                                                         
</madlib>
